          At Anim8, we don’t just install tools — we install awareness.  
          We believe every enterprise is a living entity, shaped by its systems, its people, and its capacity to evolve.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed font-light">
          True progress starts with perception. When systems can sense, remember, and act with intelligence,
          they become more than workflows — they become aware.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-white leading-relaxed font-light">
          That’s what we do. We awaken latent potential. We animate factories.  
          We don’t just deliver software — we architect consciousness.
