# What Manufacturing Actually Needs from Metrology (And Rarely Gets)

I spent my first week in automotive manufacturing watching a $2M component sit on a cart for three days, waiting to be measured.

The part had failed a downstream quality check. Production was convinced it was within spec when it left their station. But to prove it, the component needed to go to the metrology labâ€”a climate-controlled room two buildings away, where it would wait in queue behind 47 other parts, get measured in a 6-hour cycle, and generate a report that would arrive 18 hours after the part first failed.

By the time we had data, we'd built 2,400 more parts.

This wasn't an exception. This was Tuesday.

## The Real Requirements

Let's start with what manufacturing engineering actually needs to do their job well:

**Fast feedback loops.** When a process drifts, hours matter. Sometimes minutes matter.
