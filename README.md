# Anim8 Web Page

Welcome to the Anim8 website repository. This project powers the digital presence of **Anim8**, a visionary company reimagining manufacturing through conscious systems, intelligent integration, and technological awakening.

Our site showcases Anim8â€™s philosophy, services, and products â€” and acts as the digital front door for a growing ecosystem of collaborators, clients, and future partners.

## ðŸ§  Project Purpose

This site is designed to:

- Present Anim8â€™s mission, philosophy, and team
- Capture inbound interest via email forms
- Serve as a foundation for future tools (e.g. diagnostics, lead portals, microsites)

The site is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router** (v6.4+ Data Router API).

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure & Logic
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/ # Static files like logos, textures, and future exports
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ # All UI building blocks, grouped semantically

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Pages/ # Page-level component wrappers (TeamPage, HomePage)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ui/ # Reusable presentational components (buttons, cards, inputs)
â”œâ”€â”€ context/ # Global app context (theme, auth, etc)
â”œâ”€â”€ router/ # Centralized route logic using React Router (6.4+)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ layouts/ # Layouts used inside routes (e.g., RootLayout with <Outlet />)
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/ # Global and custom styles (index.css, variables)

â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ # Utility functions (formatters, validators, etc)

## ðŸ§¾ Coding Standards

- **File naming:** `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for files & functions
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + global theme variables in `styles/index.css`
- **Routing:** React Router v6.4+ using `createBrowserRouter` and `createRoutesFromElements`
- **State Management:** Local state + React Context where needed (no Redux)
- **Component Split:**  
  - Logic-heavy pages go in `Pages/`  
  - Pure UI units go in `ui/`  
  - Cross-cutting wrappers (e.g. NavBar) go in `layout/`
